Hello. My name is Nazarii. And I am junior frontend developer.
Today I want to introduce myself.
My path as a developer began back in the 2000s, when I started learning Pascal and Delphi in computer science classes.
I graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum. Nevertheless, I decided to study international business in Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.
However, even while studying to be an economist, I decided to create an ISP in the Hostel to have unlimited Internet access and provide it to other students.
After university, I worked CEO in a small Internet provider in Odesa.
But I was always interested in technical side of the company's work.
I completed several MikroTik courses to understand how equipment for ISP works and realized that I can no longer live without programming.
I have always wanted to write some script for MikroTik routers to expand its functionality.
It was great fun getting a notification when my wife got home because her phone connected to the home wi-fi router.
After covid, I realized that the best solution is to go to work as a developer with the possibility of remote work.
This is the work that will be convenient for me and will bring me pleasure.
That's why I opened Google and found the largest IT company in Ukraine, EPAM.
It was on the EPAM website that I got to know the RS school.
Now I'm still learning to be a developer, but I know that very soon, when I master full stack development, I will be able to write any program and solve any problem.
Programming gives incredible opportunities to create everything from nothing. And I want to be able to do it.
That was the boring part of this video.
And now, I hope, will be the funny part.
Let's talk about my latest project.
It was birdsong.
I spent a long time trying to complete the task.
But the funniest moment was when my son saw my work and wanted to play this game.
And what do you think?
He liked it.
He even found a few bugs.
It was not easy to fix them. But I did it.
That’s all. I hope you enjoyed this video
Thank you for attention and have a good day.
Even if it’s nigh.
